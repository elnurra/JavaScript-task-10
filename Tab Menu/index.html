                    Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don't taste sweetness. Cats are nearsighted, but their
                    peripheral vision and night vision are much better than that of humans. Cats are supposed to have 18
                    toes (five toes on each front paw; four toes on each back paw). Cats can jump up to six times their
                    length.

                <p>
                    A dog is a domestic mammal of the family Canidae and the order Carnivora. Its scientific name is
                    Canis lupus familiaris. Dogs are a subspecies of the gray wolf, and they are also related to foxes
                    and jackals. Dogs are one of the two most ubiquitous and most popular domestic animals in the world.

                <h2>Rabbits</h2>
                <p>
                    Happy rabbits practice a cute behavior known as a “binky:” they jump up in the air and twist and
                    spin around! A baby rabbit is called a kit, a female is called a doe, and a male is a buck. A group
                    of rabbits is called a herd. Rabbits are herbivores, eating a diet entirely of grasses and other
                    plants.
